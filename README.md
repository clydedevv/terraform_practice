# AWS Terraform Infrastructure Project

This Terraform project sets up a web application infrastructure on AWS, designed for scalability, security, and maintainability across three environments: 
development, staging, and production.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.tf`: Main Terraform configuration file that orchestrates various modules.
- `terraform.tfstate` & `terraform.tfstate.backup`: Terraform state files.
- `modules/`: Contains reusable modules specific to different components of the infrastructure.
  - `iam/`: Manages IAM roles and policies.
  - `s3_buckets/`: Responsible for S3 bucket creation and configuration.
  - `cloudfront/`: Handles CloudFront distribution setup.

## Modules Overview

### S3 Buckets Module (`s3_buckets/`)

Responsible for creating and configuring Amazon S3 buckets to store static content. Implements versioning and server-side encryption for security.

### IAM Module (`iam/`)

Sets up IAM roles and policies, ensuring access control adheres to the principle of least privilege.

### CloudFront Module (`cloudfront/`)

Manages AWS CloudFront distributions for efficient and secure content delivery, integrated with S3 buckets.

## Environment Management

The infrastructure is tailored for the following environments:
- **Development (`dev`):** For development and testing.
- **Staging (`staging`):** Pre-production testing environment.
- **Production (`prod`):** Live environment for end-users.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the infrastructure in your desired environment:

1. Initialize Terraform:

'''bash
terraform init
'''


2. Apply the configuration for the specific environment:

'''bash
terraform apply -var="environment=dev" # For development
terraform apply -var="environment=staging" # For staging
terraform apply -var="environment=prod" # For production
'''


3. Review the plan and approve to proceed with the deployment.

## Security and Best Practices

- Securely manages S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions with appropriate IAM roles and policies.
- Enforces HTTPS for CloudFront distributions, particularly in production.

## Scalability

- Leverages AWS services known for scalability: S3 for storage and CloudFront for content distribution.
- Configuration can be easily adjusted to accommodate scaling needs.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Implement S3 bucket replication and regular backups for critical data.
- Plan for disaster recovery based on the application's specific requirements.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Consider integrating with AWS CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring and logging (to be set up as per the production environment's needs).

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate advanced monitoring and logging.
- Explore additional AWS services for performance optimization and cost efficiency.

## Note

- Regularly update and review the Terraform configuration to align with evolving AWS features and best practices.
